Open Location Code is a technology that gives a way of encoding location into a form that is
easier to use than latitude and longitude. The codes generated are called plus codes, as their
distinguishing attribute is that they include a "+" character.

The technology is designed to produce codes that can be used as a replacement for street addresses, especially
in places where buildings aren't numbered or streets aren't named.

Plus codes represent an area, not a point. As digits are added
to a code, the area shrinks, so a long code is more precise than a short
code.

Codes that are similar are located closer together than codes that are
different.

A location can be converted into a code, and this (full) code can be converted back to a location completely offline, without any data tables to lookup or online services required.

Codes can be shortened for easier communication, in which case they can be used regionally or in combination with a reference location that all users of this short code need to be aware of. If the reference location is given in form of a location name, use of a geocoding service might be necessary to recover the original location.

Algorithms to

- encode and decode full codes,
- shorten them relative to a reference location, and
- recover a location from a short code and a reference location given as latitude/longitude pair

are publicly available and can be used without restriction. Geocoding services are not a part of the Open Location Code technology.
